            { text: "3.1. The Grammar Translation Method", info: "Used up to very recent times, it consisted in the very rigid presentation of grammar. It was first used to teach Greek and Latin. Students had to master Latin grammar and vocabulary, being exposed to literary texts. Such methodology did not include conversation because its purpose was to assimilate the prescriptive grammars and then proceed to read its literature. <br><br> This method then began to be used to for the teaching of modern languages. It was usually done by studying grammar rules of the L2 and interpreting texts using the  dictionary. This methodology was useful for individuals, but not for young students at school. <br><br> In this context, the Grammar Translation Method aimed at adapting language teaching to schools’ needs. It consisted in studying the grammar rules and the vocabulary of the target language. The teacher was the authority in the classroom and used the L1 to communicate in the classroom. Therefore, there was always the same pattern: <br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 1. The rule <br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 2. A vocabulary list <br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 3. Translation <br><br> Accuracy became more important than fluency, dedicating a great amount of time to memorization (which is the contrary conception of the communicative approach). The purpose of this method was to enable students to read literature in the target language." },
            { text: "3.2. Direct or Natural Methods", info: "It was developed in France by Sauver and Berlitz from 1860 to 1920. This teaching trend assumes that learning a language is an intuitive process for which human beings have an innate capacity. This capacity can be awakened by proper conditions: <br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - Society uses the target language. <br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - There is something to talk about <br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - There is a desire to understand and be understood. <br><br> This method provides a good insight to the understanding of what the Communicative Approach is. The Direct Method establishes that: <br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - The target language must be used as a means of instruction in the classroom. <br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - Grammar is taught inductively through examples. <br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - There is interaction between students, as the class is based on oral learning. <br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - Texts are given to students and the difficult expressions are analysed and paraphrased with synonyms. <br><br> As a way of concluding this method, it could be said that: <br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - Languages should first be taught orally. <br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - Languages should be taught by usage and not memorization. <br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - The mother tongue mustn’t be used." },
            { text: "4.1. The Berlitz School", info: "The Berlitz School has its foundations in the Direct Method. It was founded in <b>1878</b> in Rhode Island by <b>Maximiliam Berlitz</b>. His slogan was “the eye is the enemy of the ear”, which is true in the case of English. It was immensely successful, to the point that more than 200 schools were opened all over the world by 1914. French, German and English were taught at the beginning but the number of languages increased in time. In Berlitz Schools the teachers were all native speakers of the language they taught. They worked with a series of directions (as Berlitz never wrote a manual) and a routinized methodology; the layout and content of the textbooks were the basic means of exerting control over standards and aims. This method put a strong emphasis on oral work by means of question-and-answer techniques. As Stubbs said &quot;The study of language is a study of meanings, but meanings cannot be discovered by introspection or by consulting dictionaries. They must be sought in the contexts in which language is used&quot; (Stubbs, 2001, p. 2). Therefore, translation and the use of the mother tongue were completely forbidden whereas grammatical explanations were not given until late in the course. <br><br> There has been a change over the last half century in the way that languages have been taught. Teachers, students and linguists realised that the most important element of language learning is the ability to communicate. As Littlewood said &quot;Language teaching is not about &#39;knowing grammar&#39; but about acquiring the ability to use a language for real-life communication purposes.&quot; (Littlewood, 1981). Due to this, many methods have been developed to achieve this objective, culminating with the development of the “communicative approach”." },
            { text: "5.1. Situational language teaching", info: "This method has structuralist roots emphasizing the context of language, one of the main characteristics of the Communicative approach. There is a vocabulary selection used in listening and speaking first followed by reading and writing. There are also guided repetitions, controlled oral tasks etc and a written practice focused on dictations." },
            { text: "5.2. The notional functional syllabus", info: "It started after Chomsky’s reaction against mechanical methods. It was the first real communicative method split into 2 functions: notions and “macrofunctions”. <br><br> The main goal was the knowledge of rules plus the “when, how, and to whom” to use them. The language was used within a context and the role of the teacher was too dominant. <br><br> It can be said this approach is a way of structuring a syllabus around “notions” which are real-life situations in which people communicate and which are further broken down into “functions”, which are specific aims of communication." },

            { text: "5.3.1. The silent way", info: "The method was created by Gattegno who viewed language as a group of sounds with individual meanings. It emphasizes a need to be autonomous from the teacher and the learning process; the method is learner-centred. Students should be able to use the language for self-expression; unnecessary language is omitted; the student learns to associate sounds with colours." },
            { text: "5.3.2. Suggestopedia", info: "Created by Lozanov, it is based on external elements such as decoration, furniture or music to encourage language learning; he thought that the human mind is capable of amazing things if the learning process takes place in the right conditions. The students are made as comfortable as possible. During the course they create whole biographies to go along with their new identities. The students use lengthy dialogues in the target language and a translation in their own language" },
            { text: "5.3.3. Community language teaching", info: "Developed by Curran, it focused on the social view of language. The idea is that students learn the language in settings similar to those that they would encounter in the real world." },
            { text: "5.3.4. Total physical response", info: "This method did not really have success in adults but it had great effect on children; it uses commands and makes them participate. Physical movement is used to react to verbal input in order to reduce student inhibitions and lower their affective filter." },

These are incorporated into the Spanish curriculum established by the Royal Decree to include Linguistic competence. The original five are: grammatical (mastery of the language), Discourse (grammar used with meanings), Strategic (how to manage to supply a lack in language), sociolinguistic (how to use different patterns in contexts) and sociocultural (how a native speaker would react in a given situation). <br><br> In this method, the students’ native language has no particular role, it emphasizes function and form, it aims to teach communicative competence, and not just linguistic competence, fluency is not encouraged, and it centres on the learner rather than the teacher. <br><br> The target language is used to explain things to the students and the teacher evaluates their fluency and the accuracy; errors are seen as natural. Teachers who use the Communicative Approach want their students to become communicatively competent. To carry out the task, the teacher will make use of role-plays and problem-solving exercises. Authentic materials are used so that students can develop strategies used by native speakers. Activities are to be developed in small groups so that students can benefit from oral communication.

Theories of child language acquisition", info: "<b>Halliday, 2014</b> <br> “A language is a structured system of communication and social interaction”. <br><br> Distinction between first and second language: <br> - <b>First Language / Mother Tongue (L1)</b>: it is the first language speakers acquire when they are children. <br> - <b>Second Language / Foreign Language (L2)</b>: any language that is not the mother tongue of the speakers. <br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#9900; A <b>second language</b> is a non-native language that is widely used for purposes of communication, usually in education, government or business. <br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#9900; A <b>foreign language</b> is a non-native language taught at school that is not used as a daily medium of communication. <br><br> <b>The Imitation Theory</b> argues that children merely imitate what they hear. <br> <b>The Positive Reinforcement Theory</b>, children learn to produce correct sentences because they are either positively or negatively reinforced whenever they say something right or make a mistake. <br> <b>The Creative Construction Theory</b>, argues that, the imperfect sentences children use, are perfectly normal as they reflect their own grammar at a certain stage of development. Children choose the simplest and more general rules from the input they receive, so a process of overgeneralization takes place in the first stages of acquisition of a language. Two main conclusions can be drawn then: <br> - Language acquisition is a creative process as children have to construct all the rules of grammar. <br> - Children are innately equipped with a language acquisition device." },
            { text: "3. General theories of foreign language acquisition", info: "<b>Krashen’s monitor model</b>, which concentrates on the importance of comprehensible input. Other relevant theories, such as <b>Schumann’s Acculturation Model</b>, <b>Giles and Byrne’s Intergroup Model</b>, and <b>Gardner’s socio-educational model</b>, which seem to agree with the idea that a successful language acquisition depends on the social factors. <br><br> <b>a. Behaviorist learning theories</b> <br> The learning of a foreign language is a process of imitation and reinforcement; learners transfer sounds, structures and usages from L1 (mother tongue) to L2 (foreign language); in this process, two kinds of transfer take place: <br> - <b>Positive transfer</b>: the habits in L1 are acceptable in L2 (e.g. the sentence pattern subject + verb is positively transferred from English into French). <br> - <b>Negative transfer</b>, also known as interference: L1 habits cause errors in L2 (e.g. subject + verb does not satisfactorily transfer from English into Welsh). <br><br> The main aim of behaviourist teaching is to form new, correct linguistic habits through intensive practice, eliminating interference errors and benefiting from positive transfer in the process. <br><br> <b>b. Mentalist of Cognitive learning theories</b> <br> The main alternative to the behaviourist approach sees as central the role of cognitive or psychological factors in language learning. According to Error Analysis, learners use their cognitive abilities in a creative way to issue hypotheses about the rules that govern the foreign language. Learners try out these hypotheses and, if they prove to be inadequate, they alter them. In this account, language learning proceeds in a series of transitional stages that bring the learner’s language closer to the native system (trial and error). <br><br> <b>c. Interactionist learning theories</b> <br> This theory is based on the importance that learners must receive a modified input when interacting with native speakers. Michael Long and Krashen, supporters of this theory, claim that comprehensible input is essential for language acquisition. But, to make input comprehensible, there must be some interactional modifications in a conversation between a native speaker and a non-native speaker. This could be summarized as follows: <br> 1. Interactional modification makes input comprehensible. <br> 2. Comprehensible input promotes acquisition. <br> 3. Interactional modification promotes acquisition. <br><br> Krashen’s theory is based on five basic hypotheses: <br> - <b>The Acquisition-Learning Hypothesis</b>: <br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#9900; <b>Acquisition</b> is a subconscious process <br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#9900; <b>Learning</b> is a conscious process <br><br> - <b>The Monitor Hypothesis</b>: <br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#9900; <b>Monitor over-users</b>: learners who attempt to monitor all the time, victims of grammar instruction. <br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#9900; <b>Monitor under-users</b>: performers who have not learned or, if they have, prefer to use their own communicative knowledge. <br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#9900; <b>Optimal monitor users</b>: they fall in between the previous types. The aim of language teaching is setting the conditions for this type of learners. <br><br> - <b>The Natural Order Hypothesis</b>: <br> This hypothesis holds that learners acquire the rules of language in a predictable order, some rules tending to come earlier than others. The order does not appear to be determined solely by formal simplicity as there is evidence that it is independent of the order in which rules are taught in language classes. <br><br> - <b>The Input Hypothesis</b>: <br> This hypothesis postulates that humans acquire language in only one way: by understanding messages or by receiving comprehensible input. We move from our current level (L) to “L + 1”, that is, the next level along the natural order. For Krashen, comprehensible input is the road to acquisition and information about grammar in the target language is automatically available when the input is understood. <br><br> - <b>The Affective Filter Hypothesis</b>: <br> According to this hypothesis, intrapersonal or affective factors play an important role in acquiring a second language. Comprehensible input may not be used by learners of a second language if there is a mental block that prevents them from fully profiting from it. The affective filter acts as a barrier to acquisition: the filter is up when the acquirer is unmotivated, lacking in confidence or concerned with failure. The filter is down when the acquirer is not anxious and is trying to become a member of the speaking group. <br><br> There are three main implications of Krashen’s theory for the teaching of a second or foreign language: <br> - Input should be comprehensible and motivating for students. <br> - Students should not be forced to speak before they feel ready. <br> - Grammar must be placed in its proper place" },
            { text: "4. The concept of interlanguages", info: "The language system that the learners of a foreign language construct out of the input they receive has been called in different ways: idiosyncratic dialect (Corder), approximate system (Nemser) and interlanguage (<b>Selinker, 1972</b>). Selinker uses this term to refer to the specific language that learners of a second or foreign language speak. It refers to the language of a given learner at a given time, a system which is not either his/her mother tongue or the target language, having in this way, a structurally intermediate status. By a gradual process of trial and errors and hypotheses testing, learners slowly and tediously succeed in establishing closer and closer approximations to the system used by native speakers." },
            { text: "4.1. Stages of interlanguage", info: "The first stage of interlanguage is the stage of <b>random errors</b>, in which the learner is only vaguely aware that there is some systematic order for a particular class of items. <br> During the second or <b>emergent stage</b> the learner’s linguistic production is growing in consistency. He has begun to discern a system and to internalise certain rules, which may or may not be correct. <br> The third stage is a truly <b>systematic stage</b> in which the learner shows consistency in the production of language. The learner now is able to correct errors when they are pointed out. <br> The fourth stage is one of <b>stabilization</b>. At this level, fluency and intended meanings are not problematic. The learner is able to self-correct his/her own mistakes manifesting the fossilization of the system. <br> The interlanguage theory has several implications on language teaching; the most important of them is the syllabus organization. Syllabuses should be more similar to the learner’s developmental syllabus. They should be focussed on communication and not so much on the learning of grammar. Teachers and teaching materials must adapt to the student and not vice-versa." },
            { text: "5. Error treatment", info: "The treatment of errors is one of the main points to focus on when dealing with methodology in the teaching of a foreign language. An error is a noticeable deviation from the correct use of the target language system. Errors are the result of a lack of knowledge and should be distinguished from mistakes. A mistake is a failure when using a system known beforehand due to a random guess or simply, to a slip of the tongue. Two main theories have approached the treatment of errors: <b>Contrastive Analysis</b> and <b>Error Analysis.</b>" },
            { text: "5.1. The contrastive analysis hypothesis", info: "This theory, deeply rooted in behaviourism and structuralism, claims that the main barrier to the acquisition of a second or foreign language is the interference of the first language system with that of the second. The solution proposed is a scientific, structural analysis of the two languages in question in order to predict the difficulties that learners would encounter. The aim is creating correct habits avoiding errors at all costs; the main pedagogical practices to do so are imitation and pattern practice. <br> However, this account shows some problems as imitation alone does not provide learners with the ability to create and recognize new utterances that go beyond the limitations of the model sentences they may have practiced. On the other hand, it has been proved that many of the errors language learners make are not related to their mother tongue, most of them are due to overgeneralizations or simply, to lack of knowledge. The conclusion is that imitation and interference avoidance on their own are not enough in the process of acquiring of a foreign language." },
            { text: "5.2. Error analysis", info: "Up to the 1960s, errors had been traditionally regarded as regrettable deviations from the target language norm which had to be avoided at all costs but from then on the learner acquires the status of active participant in the language learning process and errors are reclassified as inevitable, necessary and systematic in the process of learning of a second language. Language learning is a process that involves the making of errors. Errors are positive because they facilitate feedback and therefore, correction. A learner’s errors are significant in that they provide the researcher with evidence of how language is learned or acquired and what strategies or procedures the learner is employing in the discovery of the language. The correction of errors is bonded to the process of teaching. The goal of correction is making students think about their mistakes in order to overcome them. Only what has been presented beforehand must be corrected. The main question is: when should teachers correct a mistake? There are three stages for correction which fall between the three steps that a didactic unit should include: presentation, practice and production. <br> During the first stage, that is, between the presentation and the practice, only a soft or polite correction should be used in order not to frighten the student, cutting his initiative. Some polite correction techniques at this level are repeating the mistake and correcting it or using face expressions and body language. <br> The second stage is the best time for correction as it is right between the practice and the production time. Some correction techniques at this level are highlighting the mistake, passing the correction to students, using signs, symbols and codes to stress a type of mistake or using the voice to emphasize the mistake. <br> In the third stage, that is, after production, fossilization has usually taken place. It is very difficult that correction becomes useful now. Repetition and practice are the best techniques to use at this level." },

            { text: "2. What is communication?", info: "Communication can be described as “any encounter or interaction between two or more people to exchange and negotiate information through verbals and non-verbals” (Mark Knapp and Gerald Miller). As mentioned before and reinforced by this statement, “communication is a social function” (Cherry, 1966). <br> Interaction between members of society requires the presence of both, verbals and non-verbals, meaning that it is not just language (<b>verbals</b>) the element that transmits information, but also extralinguistic elements (<b>non-verbals</b>) that must be considered, such as: <br> - The <b>context</b> where the communication takes place or any piece of information already known by the individuals taking part in a conversation. <br> - <b>Prosodic features</b>, such as stress, rhythm or intonation that add extra meaning. <br> - <b>Extralinguistic elements</b>, that are used in order to add weight to the words and messages that are trying to be communicated. <br><br> Jackobson’s (1987) diagram: <br> - <b>Addresser</b>: this person acts as the source of the communication. This person encodes the message. <br> - <b>Addressee</b>: this person is the recipient of the message. This person decodes the message. <br> - <b>Context</b>: this is the situation that the addresser and addressee are in at the moment of communicating. It is also known as the referent. The situation helps the participants code and decode the message. The addressee should have some notion of the context for the message to be successful. <br> - <b>Message</b>: it refers to the intended communication from the addresser to the addressee. <br> - <b>Channel</b>: it is the means used to transmit the message (telephone, physical contact, voice, etc.). <br> - <b>Code</b>: it refers to the system of signs used to transmit the message. It must be common (or partially common) between the addresser and the addressee. <br><br> When taking this to the classroom, in order to establish a quality act of communication, the “cooperative principle” must be followed, which can be summarized as follows: BE TRUE, BE BRIEF, BE RELEVANT, BE CLEAR. <br> This will enhance learners to use language in a way in which communication is enhanced." },
            { text: "3. Functions of language", info: "<b>Malinowski’s (1923)</b> anthropological functions of language, divided into two categories: <br> - <b>Pragmatic</b>: it is the practical use of the language, in which people can communicate either by using words (speech) or narrative (texts). <br> - <b>Magical</b>: it is the language used in ceremonies, particularly in religious ones. <br><br> <b>Schumann (1976)</b>, made a difference between a wider spectrum of functions: <br> - <b>Communicative function</b>: it concerns the transmission of information. The speaker uses language to interact with the listener. This function can be used to inform, argue or debate, illustrate or order. <br> - <b>Integrative function</b>: it uses language to mark the speaker as a member of a particular social group. This distinction can either be social (belonging to a certain social class) or professional (the speaker uses specific language of his/her professional background). <br> - <b>Expressive function</b>: it uses language to display linguistic virtuosity, such as in literacy, where the aim is to evoke feelings in the listener. <br><br> <b>Karl Bühler (1934)</b> also gave his point of view to the functions of language from a standpoint not so much of culture, but of the individual. With this concept, he established a difference between expressive language, conative language and representational language. <br> - <b>Expressive language</b>: orientated towards the addresser. It is the ability to express your wants and needs through verbal or nonverbal communication. <br> - <b>Conative language</b>: orientated towards the addressee. It is the use of a word to suggest a different association than its literal meaning, which is known as denotation (e.g. blue is a colour, but it’s also used to express a feeling). <br> - <b>Representational language</b>: orientated towards the rest of reality (something or someone different from the addresser or the addressee). It is the ability to associate meaning to mental images (e.g. “tic tac” can be used to give a mental representation of a clock and time passing)." },
            { text: "4. Negotiating meaning", info: "When the participants of a conversation work together to share information, they are negotiating meaning. In communication, meaning refers to the shared understanding of symbols, words, gestures or signs that enable individuals to make sense of their world and interact with others. This understanding is not inherent in language itself but arises from how participants in a conversation or interaction interpret and respond to those symbols within specific contexts. <br><br> Human communication is a reciprocal process. As individuals express themselves through language or other symbolic systems, they expect their interlocutors to interpret their messages in certain ways. In fact, &quot;Speakers constantly adapt their language use to suit the changing dynamics of the interaction and to achieve their communicative goals. This can result in a range of linguistic phenomena, such as overlaps, interruptions, and repairs, which need to be carefully analyzed in order to understand the structure and organization of conversation&quot; (Eggins &amp; Slade, 2015, p. 294). Interpretation is influenced by each individual’s prior knowledge, experiences, cultural background and social context. As observed, the variability in interpretation creates a need for constant negotiation to ensure that participants are on the same page. <br><br> When extrapolating this concept to language learning, the speaker and the listener must overcome communicative difficulties that arise as a result of their limited knowledge of the language. To do so, learners of an L2 use a series of strategies and tactics that make up for their lack of knowledge of the new language." },
            { text: "4.1. Strategies", info: "Strategies can be defined as a set of devices used to facilitate conversation between non-native speakers of a language: <br> - <b>Relinquish topic control</b>: to allow the non-native speaker to maintain a conversation, the control of the topic of this conversation should be controlled by the learner of the language to stay within the boundaries of his/her knowledge. <br> - <b>Checking understanding</b>: to avoid the learner from getting frustrated, every once in a while, there should be a check of the understanding of the concepts that are being introduced. This way, the learner can follow the conversation." },
            { text: "4.2. Tactics", info: "Tactics can be defined as a set of devices that are complementary to strategies to facilitate a conversation between learners of a language: <br> - <b>Switch of topic</b>: if the learner does not have the enough knowledge to maintain a certain conversation, a change of topic can increase the fluency of a conversation. <br> - <b>Speed reduction</b>: as the term implies, it is the decrease of speed so that participants can pay attention to the speaker. <br> - <b>Repetition and synonyms</b>: it is the repetition or the use of similar words or expressions that simplify the message that the speaker is sending." },

Communicating & negotiating meaning in today’s foreign language classroom", info: "Students will be more motivated to study a foreign language if they feel that they are learning to do something useful with the language that they are studying.

            { text: "2. What is “communicative competence”?", info: "Communicative competence in discussion of second/foreign language proficiency dates from early 1970s. The concept of communicative competence, as expressed in the words of <b>Savignon (2017)</b>, is “if the purpose of language study is language use, then the development of language proficiency should be guided and evaluated by the learner’s ability to communicate”. <br><br> The early history of this concept of language teaching emerged from the mid-20 th century. History says that there was an appreciation for the revolutionary impact of early proposals for language teaching that would reflect an underlying construct of communicative competence. In the 1940s, linguists at the University of Michigan were engaged in developing materials for teaching English to international students studying in the United States. Dissatisfied with prevailing grammar-translation materials for their purpose, they looked instead to the dominant language and learning theories of the time: structural linguistics and behaviorist psychology. Language was seen as a set of grammatical structures––phonemes, morphemes, and syntax—that could be learned through extensive drilling of grammatical patterns and pronunciation. At about the same time, the US entry into World War II had resulted in the military need for speakers and interpreters of a wide range of native languages, some of them unwritten. The result was the Army Specialized Training Program (ASTP), an oral-based program involving intensive study and drill. Commercialization of the “army method” and materials for wider use in US schools took place during the Cold War period that followed World War II, giving birth to the concept that now falls under the title of communicative competence (Savignon, 2017)." },

The evolution of communicative competence through different authors", info: "<b>Celce-Murcia, 2001</b> <br> &quot;Communicative competence is the ability to use language effectively and appropriately in the various social contexts of everyday interactions in which language is used&quot; <br><br> Once the concept of the communicative competence was considered, many authors started to develop this idea through different theories." },
            { text: "3.1. Saussure, Chomsky &amp; Dell Hymes", info: "Starting with <b>Saussure</b>, he was the first linguist who established a difference between the language as a system, that he called “langue” and the act of speaking, that he named “parole”. He is considered one of the founders of linguistics in the 20th C. <br><br> Similar to this theory was that of <b>Chomsky</b>, who, when speaking about language, said that each user has a subconscious knowledge of the grammar rules of his/her language. That is what Chomsky called “linguistic Competence”. But each person uses his/her own competence to repeat, understand and produce new utterances, and this is the “linguistic Performance”. <br> So, according to him, the proper object of study is not language as it is produced in everyday situations (that is performance), but the inner knowledge of grammar that everyone has in his/ her mind (that is competence). <br><br> To study language, then, we need to turn away from real usage and look to the knowledge of grammar all speakers possess, and which has nothing to do with the social situation within which they happen. From the beginning, this concept of the linguist´s task had criticism and one of the most telling critiques was made by the sociolinguist <b>Dell Hymes.</b> <br><br> Dell Hymes first developed his ideas on communicative competence in a conference paper published as “Competence and Performance in Linguistic Theory” in 1971, and later in a more elaborated article called “On Communicative Competence”, in 1972. <br><br> Hymes criticized Chosmky´s theory, but what were these critiques about? Hymes was concerned that Chomsky´s notions of competence and performance were incomplete for the fact that one of the things that people know about language is how to use it appropriately depending on the situation. <br><br> Hymes thought that a knowledge of the system and the production of grammatical sentences were not enough to define communicative competence and he introduced a social component to develop his theory. Native speakers know more than just grammatical competence. Users know when, where and how they can use the language and to whom. He called it “Communicative Competence”. <br><br> <b>Hymes´communicative competence theory</b> includes the following features: <br> - <b>Systematic potential</b>: Similar to Chomsky´s linguistic competence. It refers to the possibilities of using the system to create language. <br> - <b>Appropriacy</b>: given a situation, the speaker knows what is adequate to use, taking some factors into account: people, place, time, aim,…). <br> - <b>Occurrence</b>: how often something is said in a language. <br> - <b>Feasibility</b>: the possible use of some constructions in a language. <br><br> As observed, Hymes includes socio-linguistic and psychological factors that address the fact that communication takes place in a context. He suggests, then, that linguistic competence is a subdivision of the communicative competence. Language is one mode of communication among others. Real and full communication includes gestures, non-verbal elements and visual aids." },
            { text: "3.2. Canale &amp; Swain", info: "The notion of communicative competence was taken up by several groups of researchers like <b>Canale and Swain</b> in 1980. They developed their theory of communicative competence, and since then, it is one of the most widely accepted. <br><br> Before giving a definition of communicative competence, they tried to define the concept of communication. They established communication as a form of social interaction that has a high degree of unpredictability and creativity, it takes place in a socio-cultural context, it is carried out under conditions like memory fatigue, it has a purpose and finally, it is successful or not depending on the outcome. <br><br> According to them, communicative competence is the system of knowledge and skills required for communication under several conditions like psychological, sociological or environmental conditions. Communicative competence is made up of four competence areas: linguistic, sociolinguistic, discourse, and strategic. <br> - <b>Linguistic competence</b> is knowing how to use the grammar, syntax, and vocabulary of a language. Linguistic competence asks: What words do I use? How do I put them into phrases and sentences? <br> - <b>Sociolinguistic competence</b> is knowing how to use and respond to language appropriately, given the setting, the topic, and the relationships among the people communicating. Sociolinguistic competence asks: Which words and phrases fit this setting and this topic? How can I express a specific attitude (courtesy, authority, friendliness, respect) when I need to? How do I know what attitude another person is expressing? <br> - <b>Discourse competence</b> is knowing how to interpret the larger context and how to construct longer stretches of language so that the parts make up a coherent whole. Discourse competence asks: How are words, phrases and sentences put together to create conversations, speeches, email messages, newspaper articles? <br> - <b>Strategic competence</b> is knowing how to recognize and repair communication breakdowns, how to work around gaps in one’s knowledge of the language, and how to learn more about the language and in the context. Strategic competence asks: How do I know when I’ve misunderstood or when someone has misunderstood me? What do I say then? How can I express my ideas if I don’t know the name of something or the right verb form to use? <br><br> In the early stages of language learning, instructors and students may want to keep in mind the goal of communicative competence: That learners should be able to make themselves understood, using their current proficiency to the fullest. They should try to avoid confusion in the message (due to faulty pronunciation, grammar, or vocabulary); to avoid offending communication partners (due to socially inappropriate style); and to use strategies for recognizing and managing communication breakdowns. <br><br> To repair breakdowns students can do the following: paraphrase, use of generalizations, use of paralinguistics, use of fillers or simply appeal to help. <br><br> In general, willingness, confidence and motivation can compensate for deficiencies in language. It has been discussed that the teaching of these communicative strategies is not necessary because they are universal but it is much better if we can help our students teaching them in several ways." },

Communicative competence in today’s foreign language education", info: "Students will be more motivated to study a foreign language if they feel that they are learning to do something useful with the language that they are studying.

These are incorporated into the Spanish curriculum established by the Royal Decree to include Linguistic competence. The original four are: Discourse (grammar used with meanings), Strategic (how to manage to supply a lack in language), sociolinguistic (how to use different patterns in contexts) and sociocultural (how a native speaker would react in a given situation). <br><br> In this method, the students’ native language has no particular role, it emphasizes function and form, it aims to teach communicative competence, and not just linguistic competence, fluency is not encouraged, and it centres on the learner rather than the teacher. <br><br> The target language is used to explain things to the students and the teacher evaluates their fluency and the accuracy; errors are seen as natural.

What is communication?", info: "Communication can be described as “any encounter or interaction between two or more people to exchange and negotiate information through verbals and non-verbals” (Mark Knapp and Gerald Miller). As mentioned before and reinforced by this statement, “communication is a social function” (Cherry, 1966). <br> Interaction between members of society requires the presence of both, verbals and non-verbals, meaning that it is not just language (<b>verbals</b>) the element that transmits information, but also extralinguistic elements (<b>non-verbals</b>) that must be considered, such as: <br> - The <b>context</b> where the communication takes place or any piece of information already known by the individuals taking part in a conversation. <br> - <b>Prosodic features</b>, such as stress, rhythm or intonation that add extra meaning. <br> - <b>Extralinguistic elements</b>, that are used in order to add weight to the words and messages that are trying to be communicated. <br><br> Jackobson’s (1987) diagram: <br> - <b>Addresser</b>: this person acts as the source of the communication. This person encodes the message. <br> - <b>Addressee</b>: this person is the recipient of the message. This person decodes the message. <br> - <b>Context</b>: this is the situation that the addresser and addressee are in at the moment of communicating. It is also known as the referent. The situation helps the participants code and decode the message. The addressee should have some notion of the context for the message to be successful. <br> - <b>Message</b>: it refers to the intended communication from the addresser to the addressee. <br> - <b>Channel</b>: it is the means used to transmit the message (telephone, physical contact, voice, etc.). <br> - <b>Code</b>: it refers to the system of signs used to transmit the message. It must be common (or partially common) between the addresser and the addressee. <br><br> When taking this to the classroom, in order to establish a quality act of communication, the “cooperative principle” must be followed, which can be summarized as follows: BE TRUE, BE BRIEF, BE RELEVANT, BE CLEAR. <br> This will enhance learners to use language in a way in which communication is enhanced." },
            { text: "3. Rules and elements of oral discourse", info: "When dealing with oral communication, there are some elements that must be considered as they are present in every oral interaction; these are: prosodic features and extralinguistic elements. There will first be an analysis of the prosodic features of language, which, at a linguistic level, provide us with extra information needed to help oral communication. These prosodic elements include: stress, rhythm and intonation." },
            { text: "3.1. Prosodic features"},
            { text: "3.1.1. Stress", info: "From the point of view of production, stressed syllables depend on the speaker using more muscular energy than in unstressed ones. From the point of view of perception, stressed syllables are longer than unstressed ones and the vowels within them are more voiced in terms of pitch. There will now be a focus on stress within words, as the study of stress within longer utterances belongs to the sphere of rhythm and intonation. <br><br> Two types of stress can be distinguished in English: primary and secondary stress. The first one is also called “tonic strong stress”, whereas the second one is also known as “non-tonic strong stress”. To understand this better, in a word like “invitation”, there are two stresses, the secondary stress falling on the first syllable and the primary stress falling on the third one. <br><br> Normally, within the English language, stresses do not appear in a fixed position inside a word. This means that there is not a single position in English words where the main stress is more likely to fall than in another; there is no rule to explain, for example, why the stress falls in the first syllable in “hamburger”, whereas it falls in the last one in “Japan”. Some generalisations can be established, however: there is a tendency to stress the initial syllable or prefixes are not stressed, for instance. At the same time, some particular aspects should be considered: <br><br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a) All abstract nouns ending in -ion are stressed in the penultimate syllable: <br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; evolution &nbsp;&nbsp; mission &nbsp;&nbsp; passion <br><br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; b) Nouns ending in -ity, adjectives ending in -ic and nouns and adjectives ending in -ian are stressed in the penultimate syllable: <br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; vacuous – vacuity <br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; liberty – libertarian <br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; phoneme – phonemic <br><br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; c) Some words can operate in different categories depending on the position of the stress: <br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; contract (noun) / contract (verb) <br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; rebel (noun) / rebel (verb) <br><br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; d) Compound nouns are generally stressed on the first element, with a secondary stress on the second element, in contrast to the normal noun phrase stress pattern: <br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; black bird (compound noun) / a black bird (noun phrase)" }, 
            { text: "3.1.2. Rhythm", info: "Rhythm can be defined as the particular distribution of stresses within utterances or units of tone. The theory that English has a stress-timed rhythm implies that stressed syllables tend to occur at relatively regular intervals, producing, in this way, a succession of strong-weak patterns. This is clearly seen in any piece of spoken language like “Some/of the/books/are/new”, where we clearly note the succession: Strong (S)- Weak (W)-S-W-S. In fact, the rhythm of English sentences is said to be determined by a regular beat rather like a drum. <br><br> English speakers thus, naturally highlight some words; in this way, a difference has been established between content words and function words. Content words (nouns, verbs, adverbs and adjectives) are important to meaning when people speak, therefore, they receive a greater prominence or stress. Function words (prepositions, articles, pronouns and certain auxiliary verbs), although still significant to the overall message, do not tend to stand out in terms of stress; they generally have, however, two forms of pronunciation, a strong one and a weak one, depending of their position within the tone unit." },
            { text: "3.1.3 Intonation", info: "When dealing with language, intonation can be defined as the tune with which an utterance is pronounced. In this element, the pitch of the voice plays the most important role. The pitch is described in terms of high and low, depending on the frequency of vibration of the vocal cords. Intonation is found in sequences of phonemes uttered between pauses; these sequences are called tone units. <br><br> The rise and fall of pitch throughout the tone unit is called <b>intonation contour</b>. English has a number of intonation patterns which add conventionalised meanings to the utterance: question, statement, surprise, disbelief, sarcasm, teasing, etc. The following are the most common intonation patterns in English: <br> - <b>Falling tone</b>: this is the commonest tone in statements, “wh-“ and tag questions, one-word answers and in words, names, numbers and letters as uttered in isolation. <br> - <b>Rising tone</b>: it is used in yes/no questions and statements that are made into  question: Do you speak Greek? / You spent two summers working on a farm? <br> - <b>Fall-rise intonation</b>: it often occurs in doubtful conditions (those with if) and with initial adverbs: I’ll tell you if you bring the money / Normally we get up early <br> - <b>Rise-fall intonation</b>: normally in exclamations and expressions of shock or surprise: That’s fantastic! / Bloody hell! <br> - <b>Level tone</b>: it is sometimes used when what is to follow seems predictable: He came, he saw, he won." }, 
            { text: "3.2. Extralinguistic elements", info: "As mentioned before, interaction requires the presence of both, verbals and non-verbals. Within this context, extralinguistic elements are within the scope of non-verbals, which are important to consider in oral communication. Some of these elements may include facial and body gestures that sometimes transmit as much information as words when communicating face to face. <br><br> Gestures are universal features that can be learnt together with a language. However, gestures may vary depending on the culture. There are some gestures in English, such as the rising of two fingers, that would have little or no meaning in Spanish, but which, depending on the way the fingers are facing, can either mean “victory” or can be offensive. This means that, while dealing with oral communication, there must also be a development of the Key Competence of the curriculum known as “Conscience and Cultural Expressions”." },
            { text: "4. Common routines and strategies", info: "When the participants of a conversation work together to share information, they are negotiating meaning. In communication, meaning refers to the shared understanding of symbols, words, gestures or signs that enable individuals to make sense of their world and interact with others. This understanding is not inherent in language itself but arises from how participants in a conversation or interaction interpret and respond to those symbols within specific contexts. <br><br> Human communication is a reciprocal process. As individuals express themselves through language or other symbolic systems, they expect their interlocutors to interpret their messages in certain ways. However, interpretation is influenced by each individual’s prior knowledge, experiences, cultural background and social context. As observed, the variability in interpretation creates a need for constant negotiation to ensure that participants are on the same page. <br><br> When extrapolating this concept to language learning, the speaker and the listener must overcome communicative difficulties that arise as a result of their limited knowledge of the language. To do so, learners of an L2 use a series of strategies and formulas that make up for their lack of knowledge of the new language." },
            { text: "4.1. Strategies", info: "Strategies can be defined as a set of devices used to facilitate conversation between non-native speakers of a language: <br> - <b>Relinquish topic control</b>: to allow the non-native speaker to maintain a conversation, the control of the topic of this conversation should be controlled by the learner of the language to stay within the boundaries of his/her knowledge. <br> - <b>Checking understanding</b>: to avoid the learner from getting frustrated, every once in a while, there should be a check of the understanding of the concepts that are being introduced. This way, the learner can follow the conversation." },
            { text: "4.2. Tactics", info: "Tactics can be defined as a set of devices that are complementary to strategies to facilitate a conversation between learners of a language: <br> - <b>Switch of topic</b>: if the learner does not have the enough knowledge to maintain a certain conversation, a change of topic can increase the fluency of a conversation. <br> - <b>Speed reduction</b>: as the term implies, it is the decrease of speed so that participants can pay attention to the speaker. <br> - <b>Repetition and synonyms</b>: it is the repetition or the use of similar words or expressions that simplify the message that the speaker is sending. <br><br> Furthermore, on this topic, it is also important to mention Seaville and Troike when dealing with linguistic routines. These are fixed utterances or sequences of utterances which must be considered as single units, because meaning cannot be derived from consideration of any segment apart from the whole. The routine itself fulfils the communicative function, and in this respect, is performative in nature. <br><br> Routines must be learnt as well as analysed as single units, although they may vary in length from single syllables as in “Hi!” to phrases as in “How do you do?”. Finally, they can be a sequence of sentences, as in the well-rehearsed speech of a door-to-door salesman. Because of this, some are learnt at an earlier age than others. For instance, “please” and “thank you” are usually the first routines taught to English-speaking children, although they might not know exactly what they are saying. Seaville points out that, perhaps, the first sign of acquired meaning comes when a child looks sad or cries when the parents say “goodbye”. This shows that routines are memorised as fixed forms. The process through which we acquire these routines is perhaps the most fundamental socialisation people make of language. <br><br> As mentioned before with extralinguistic elements, learning routines from another culture means to develop the “Conscience and Cultural Expressions” Key Competence from the curriculum, having to dedicate certain time within the classroom to its development." },

In the classroom, the aforementioned aspects of communication must be used in order to interact and communicate through the process of negotiation of meaning.

The original four are: grammatical or linguistic (mastery of the language), Discourse (grammar used with meanings), Strategic (how to manage to supply a lack in language) and sociolinguistic (how to use different patterns in contexts). <br><br> When communication is encouraged in the classroom, there is a negotiation of meaning results in different types of input and interaction. In particular, it has been hypothesised that negotiation makes input comprehensible and, just as established by <b>Krashen (1992)</b>, humans acquire language in only one way: by understanding messages or by receiving comprehensible input. We move from our current level (L) to “L + 1”, that is, the next level along the natural order. For Krashen, comprehensible input is the road to acquisition and information about grammar in the target language is automatically available when the input is understood. <br><br> Communicative competence in discussion of second/foreign language proficiency dates from early 1970s.
